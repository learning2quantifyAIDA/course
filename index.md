          Policy makers or computer scientists may be interested in
    finding the needle in the haystack (...), but social scientists
       are more commonly interested in characterizing the haystack.

# Learning to Quantify (AIDA)

_Quantification_ (variously called _learning to
quantify_, or _supervised class prevalence estimation_ 
is a supervised learning task
concerned with estimating the _prevalence values_ (or
_relative frequencies_, or _prior probabilities_) of the
classes in a sample of unlabelled datapoints, using a predictive model
(the _quantifier_) trained on labelled datapoints.

Quantification finds applications in many areas whose primary focus is
the analysis of data at the _aggregate_ level (rather at the
level of the individual datapoint). A prototypical example is the
automatic analysis of Tweet streams in terms of the user
stance towards a specific aspect of the public opinion, say, 
whether they are favourable, contrary, or neutral in the matter
of vaccines. In such a context, we _don't care_ about the particular
stance of one specific user, since we are rather interested in 
knowing the _overall distribution_ of pro-vax, neutral, and no-vax
individuals from a population. 
These are the kinds of problems quantification addresses.

In this course, we will offer a comprehensive overview of the
field, including most important methods, evaluation measures,
sampling generation protocols, and applications of quantification.
The course also includes a _hands-on_ part, in which the students
will be guided through the implementation of fundamental concepts
of quantification. This _hands-on_ part also includes a brief 
introduction to _QuaPy_, a Python-based open-source library
for quantification.

## Structure of the course

The course will be held online (link TBA) and will be structured in 4 slots of two hours each. 
The course is scheduled as follows:

* 8 March, 16.00 - 18.00
* 10 March, 16.00 - 18.00
* 13 March, 16.00 - 18.00
* 15 March, 16.00 - 18.00

| *Alejandro Moreo*: is a Researcher at the Institute for the Science and Technologies of Information of the Italian National Council of Research (ISTI-CNR). He has obtained a PhD in Computer Science and Information Technologies from the University of Granada, Spain, in 2013.  His research interests lie at the interface of data mining and machine learning, with particular emphasis on deep learning, representation learning, and transfer learning for cross-lingual text classification. He has taught several programming courses at the University of Granada, a course on Text Mining for the MSc program in Data Science at the University of Pisa, a full-day course on text classification and sentiment analysis at AFIRM 2019, and half-day tutorials on learning to quantify at SIGIR 2019 and SocInfo 2020.

## Online Material

A download link, containing the material we will be using during the course, will be enabled soon.

## Pre-requisites:

There are no hard-constraints in this respect, although some basic notions of
statistics, machine learning, and coding skills would be welcome.
